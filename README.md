# Reddit Web Scraper 

# Introduction 

The tech reddit space has been up in arms over a controversial decision to monetise reddit's API, which has held a place in a lot of developer's hearts. In protest, a lot of reddit forums have become private as a response to this decision. Reddit has 55.79 million daily active users and 1.660 billion monthly active users in 2023. With such an active and passionate community, it is a treasure trove of information for people who want to gain information on the latest developments for their given interest/hobby. 

In response to this, I decided to use Scrapy's web scraping framework to develop a program that scrapes a defined /r for post information and then saves the output to an SQLite database for future NLP analyses.
