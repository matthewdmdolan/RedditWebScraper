# Reddit Web Scraper 

# Introduction 

The tech reddit space has been up in arms over a controversial decision to monetise reddit's API, which has held a place in a lot of developer's hearts. In protest, a lot of reddit forums have become private as a response to this decision. Reddit has 55.79 million daily active users and 1.660 billion monthly active users in 2023. With such an active and passionate community, it is a treasure trove of information for people who want to gain information on the latest developments for their given interest/hobby. 

In response to this, I decided to use Scrapy's web scraping framework to develop a program that scrapes a defined /r for post information and then saves the output to an SQLite database for future NLP analyses. 

# Data

Being my first time using Scrapy's framework, I was surprised by how quick it was able to retrieve data compared to other technologies, such as Selenium. Selenium still remains the only framework that can process pages with JS elements, however.
